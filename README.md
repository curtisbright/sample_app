# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is my implementation of the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I worked through this tutorial in its entirety in March 2012, including attempts at all of the exercises.
The resulting application is [running live on the web](https://cbright-sample-app.herokuapp.com/).
